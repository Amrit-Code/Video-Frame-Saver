# Video-Frame-Saver
Sort videos and images. Take a single frame from a video to save as an image

This is a ipynb file. Thus you would require Anaconda or a similer software to run the program.
This file will not work in Google Colab as it does not allow to show GUI objects.

This program also uses OpenCV which would need to be downloaded before you can run it.

The program works by being stored in the same directory as the images you want to sort through. 
Running the file will go thorugh your images and videos and firstly store them based by 'Date Modified'
For every Video, it will prompt you a slider where you can chose a spcific frame to save by pressing 's' 
on you keyboard. All the sorted files will be saved as '1.jpg, 2.jpg ...' based on their date modified.

The code has appropriate comments to make it easy to edit.
